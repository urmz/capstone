# Capstone, Spring 2019

This is the code repository for my senior capstone project for the Minerva Schools.

My project includes two experiments that require scraping alexa.com with BeautifulSoup for lists of websites associated with specific topics relevant to the experiment. I subsequently use ChromeDriver to send 'treatment' and 'control' units to these websites. For the project, I navigated each unit to bbc.com and categorized advertisements seen by hand to determine if there was systematic bias between my experimental groups.
